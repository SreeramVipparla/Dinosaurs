In this project,I have developed an infographic about dinosaurs according to the given user input data using Object Oriented Programming of JavaScript. I have also made sure to pull in information from a form submitted by the user and use it to complete an array of objects that will be appended back to the DOM(Document Object Model).

Additionally I have generated a 3x3 grid of tiles with the human in the center tile. Each title contains the species, an image, and a fact. When the user clicks to generate the infographic from the form, the grid appears and the form remains hidden. The facts that are displayed will be random per dinosaur with a possibility of displaying at least 6 different types of facts.
